## Challenge
Many veterans return home with auditory processing disorders due to traumatic brain injury. How can we help address this with the power of neuroscience and brain training?

## Solution

Collaborated with neuroscientists, game designers, and computer scientists to design an auditory brain training game to improve complex sound (e.g. speech) processing. Designed user study of normal hearing participants to test whether they could distinguish sounds going up and down. Contributed preliminary auditory thresholds and findings from this study to game design as well as 

## Result
